SysctlTUI is an interactive text user interface (TUI) utility for exploring and managing man:sysctl[3] parameters.
It presents the sysctl Management Information Base (MIB) as a hierarchical and navigable tree, enabling users to:

- Browse metadata for each kernel parameter.
- Retrieve and display current values.
- Modify parameters interactively from within the interface.

The UI consists of three panels: a tree view of the MIB hierarchy, a detail panel showing metadata, and a value editor.
Pressing the F1 key opens a help dialog explaining:

- When the MIB is built.
- When values are retrieved or updated.
- A link to an online guide for getting started with sysctl, including guidance on interpreting and using the displayed data.

Although still in early development (currently at version 0.0.2), SysctlTUI already offers functionality comparable to tools like package:sysutils/nsysctl[] and package:deskutils/sysctlview[].
A manual page is included, with suggestions to make the output similar to man:sysctl[8] or man:nsysctl[8].
The ToDo list outlining plans for enhancements like configuration file integration and subtree sorting by names.

SysctlTUI is open source and available via the FreeBSD Ports Collection: package:sysutils/sysctltui[].
Note: TUIs are a known accessibility issue, as they are not usable with most screen readers.
Users who access FreeBSD using a screen reader can use the package:sysutils/nsysctl[] package instead.
It is a command line utility that provides the same information as SysctlTUI, since both tools use the same underlying kernel interface.
