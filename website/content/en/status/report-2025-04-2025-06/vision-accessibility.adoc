This quarter, the review for the FreeBSD Accessibility Handbook was submitted and is available at: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50894.
The review includes a link to an HTML preview.

The handbook aims to document assistive technologies for vision accessibility available in FreeBSD, covering both the BASE system and the Ports Collection.
It is divided into two parts and contains six chapters:

. Help -- Covers how to request assistance effectively through appropriate FreeBSD communication channels.
. Virtual Terminal -- Documents vision-related accessibility features of the FreeBSD console (man:vt[4]).
. Colors -- Explains how to configure color schemes, including high-contrast themes and adjusting screen colors for ambient lighting.
. Low Vision -- Outlines accessibility tools in graphical desktop environments for users with low vision, such as screen magnifiers, readable fonts, and scaling.
. Blindness -- Describes assistive technologies for blind users, focusing primarily on screen readers and compatible tools.
. Development -- Provides resources for developers to make their software accessible, test accessibility, and improve support for users with visual impairments.

The handbook deliberately avoids images and minimizes non-plain-text elements to enhance compatibility with assistive technologies.
Tips and new ideas are welcome.
If possible, send reports to the FreeBSD Accessibility mailing list, to share and to track discussions in a public place.
