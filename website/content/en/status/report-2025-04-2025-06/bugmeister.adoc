In this quarter we stayed steady-state on the PR count.

Mark Linimon has held some voice chats on the FreeBSD Discord for "Bugmeister Office Hours".
The plan is to hold them more regularly and announce them in advance.
At the moment the schedule is Mondays at 3pm CDT (1800 UTC).

We still are doing better at triaging PRs than we are generating committer attention to the ones we have triaged.
Suggestions welcome.

We have added new search queries about Maintainer Approval (applies to Attachments) and Maintainer Feedback (applies to an entire individual Problem Report).
These queries were not easily composable from the various web forms.
This work was funded by the FreeBSD Foundation.

Please see the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Bugzilla/SearchQueries#Searches_For_Maintainer_Actions[new documentation].

We used these queries to close various PRs, and also to investigate inactive maintainers.
As of yet, we have not taken action on the latter.

A problem with the setup of the upgrade to Bugzilla 5.2 has been fixed.
Light testing shows no regressions.
Switching to this codebase is scheduled for next quarter.

link:https://github.com/linimon/patchQA[patchQA.py] still remains in beta.
The patch application code is not up to its task and must be replaced.

The other problem known with patchQA.py is that it does not know the origins of files that are installed into [.filename]#/etc# by installworld.

We have created dozens of new Bugzilla accounts by user request.
