Geomman is a new partition tool based on man:sade[8] that brings more functionality such as moving, copying, and pasting partitions.
Geomman is part of Google Summer of Code 2025.
Currently, it is available in a Gitlab repository.
But at some future time, it is expected to become a tool in the base system.

Geomman is a TUI designed to allow to growing, shrinking, moving, copying, and pasting partitions with filesystems other than UFS.
For example, users may be able to create an exFAT partition, as well as to resize an ext4 filesystem.
This would make partition management easier, because there are tools for each individual task (mainly depending on the filesystem), but none that concentrates all cases in a single tool.

For the moment, geomman only allows copying and pasting partitions.
However, for the next report the tool should be almost finished.

Currently, I am working on a mechanism to move partitions using man:dd[1].
Other approaches may be possible, so any help is very welcome.

The next steps for geomman are:

* Develop a way of moving partitions.
* Handle duplicate UUIDs between partitions when using dd.
* Add options to create, grow, and shrink more filesystem types.
