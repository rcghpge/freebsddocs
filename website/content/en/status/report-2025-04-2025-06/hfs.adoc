HFS+ (Hierarchical File System) is a legacy filesystem introduced by Apple for its BSD-based XNU operating systems.
Although HFS+ has been deprecated in favor of APFS, it is still in use on many older Apple devices, such as iPods, which rely on HFS+ volumes for storage.

While many modern operating systems include native support for HFS+, FreeBSD currently offers only limited functionality via FUSE.
This project aims to address that limitation by porting the original, now open-sourced HFS+ implementation to the FreeBSD kernel as a native filesystem driver.

The primary focus of this effort is to modernize the VFS layer to align with current FreeBSD interfaces and to adapt XNU-specific logic to their FreeBSD equivalents.

Features implemented:

* Mount support for HFS, HFS+ Volumes
* Read, stat support for directories and files
* Create support for directories and files
* mount_hfs binary
