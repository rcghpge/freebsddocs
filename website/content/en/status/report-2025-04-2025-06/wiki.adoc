Since the last status report, several people have expressed an interest in bringing the wiki up to the level it ought to be.

The ongoing discussions (mostly taking place on the FreeBSD Discord) are concerned with the topics of:

- Defining what content we consider useful.
- Ensuring that the useful content is kept current.
- Figuring out a way to keep obsolete content away from search engines.
- Add basic analytics to existing site to see what pages, if any,are actually being accessed.
- Decide on whether MoinMoin can still be useful for purpose in the short-term while we consider the longer-term needs listed above.

We do not yet have consensus on these issues.

Please join us on the FreeBSD Discord #documentation under the #wiki subthread.
