It is noteworthy that all prior FreeBSD documentation has been fully translated into Chinese, including but not limited to the following materials:

* _FreeBSD Release Notes (i386 or amd64)_
* _FreeBSD Status Reports_
* _FreeBSD Handbook_
* _FreeBSD Porters Handbook_
* _FreeBSD Articles_
* _FreeBSD Architecture Handbook_
* _Developers' Handbook_

In addition, two classic works have been translated.

* _A Quarter Century of Unix_
* _The UNIX-HATERS Handbook_, an humoristic book written in 1994 about issues that some users found in the UNIX operating system.
  It includes an anti-foreword from Dennis Ritchie, one of the authors of UNIX, which he wrote in a style similar to the one used in the handbook itself.
