=== FreeBSD on EC2

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD is available on both amd64 (Intel and AMD) and arm64 (Graviton) EC2 instances.

In the past quarter, the final bits needed for "hot plug" (and unplug) landed, allowing this to be fully functional in FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE.
FreeBSD "AMI Builder AMIs" are now being produced as part of the FreeBSD release building process (including for 14.3-RELEASE).
